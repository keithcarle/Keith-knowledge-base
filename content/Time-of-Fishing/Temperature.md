## Do Fish Care About The Temperature
Temperature plays a major role on how active fish might be. Unfortunately, fish are picky and do not like the water too hot or too cold. As mentioned above, fish are cold-blooded, meaning that they rely on the waters temperature in order to maintain their own temperature. When the water is too hot, fish typically swim deeper to find cooler water. In comparison, when it is cold, fish can swim to shallow water and rock structures to warm up. Along with this, the water temperature is heated up as the day goes on and the sun continues to shine down on the water. So when the temperature is cold, fishing during the day or early evening can result in warmer water and more fish activity.
