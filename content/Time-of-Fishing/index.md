# Does the time really matter?
The time can definitely impact how full your ice chest might be after your fishing trip. Morning and night fishing are commonly known as better fishing times. Regardless of this, fishing is much more than just the time of the day. Fish are cold-blooded and can be sensitive to water  [[Temperature|Temperature]], light, [[Weather|Weather]], biometric pressure, and even the moon phases. Early mornings and nights offer lower temperatures and light. Low light conditions can increase your chances of landing a fish since they can not see as well and be more willing to bite your bait/lure. Along with this, fish are more active during low light conditions. As crazy as it may sound, the moon cycle plays a part in the activity of fish. The moon controls the tides, so in some way it has to make sense that it affects the fish as well. There are many other animals that the moon is known to affect their feeding behavior, such as deer.
