## Rain Rain Go Away
When the weather sharply changes fish eating habits can change. When large storms, cold fronts, etc. are headed towards fish, they can feel the change in the barometric pressure. This can cause fish to eat a large amount to store up energy to front the storm. Along with this, once a storm passes, fish can go back into a feeding frenzy to refill their energy after not eating during the storm. Not only is the time of day important to think about, but when to go fishing in comparison to weather and storms is also important.
