## Topwater Fishing
Topwater fishing involves using floating lures that dance across the top of the water. Some of the most popular topwater lures are poppers, frogs, flies, stick baits, prop baits, and buzz baits. Many of these lures cause a commotion on the surface instigating fish and provoking their predatory instincts. The other baits focus less on large splashes and noise, and instead focus on mimicking an injured prey through movements like walking the dog. Walking the dog involves pulling the lure in a zig zag motion to mimic a fish or frog that is struggling to swim strait. Topwater fishing has to be done when the temperature is right and the visibility is limited.
