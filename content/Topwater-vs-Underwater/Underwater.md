## Underwater Fishing
Most fishing is done underwater as this is where most fish eat. Underwater fishing can include leaving bait on a hook floating under a float, active swimming lures, and pulling baits/lures across the sea floor. Under the water fishing is a large category with many [[Lures-Bait-Types/index|bait types]] that are mimicked. Some of the bait mimicked underwater are bait fish, crawfish, and worms. Underwater fishing can be useful when the temperature is too hot and fish need to find cool deep water. Along with this, when the temperature is too cold, fish will swim to deeper water that in stable and does not rise and sink with night and day.
