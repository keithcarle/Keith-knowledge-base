# The Time For Each
Topwater fishing can be an action packed thrill. You get to sit there dragging a lure across the top of the water, then *BAM!!*, a giant splash hits right at your lure and the next thing you know your lure is being ripped away from you. It truly is an exciting activity that can be the highlight of your fishing trip. The disappointing part is that topwater fishing can have a limited window available. As mentioned in the [[Time-of-Fishing/index|Time of Fishing]] page, water temperature is extremely impactful on the activity and location of fish. Fish will only stay in shallow water or near the top of the water when the temperature is just right. The early mornings, late evenings, and overcast days are best for top water fishing. Underwater fishing can be better when the temperature is too hot or too cold.

## Topwater
Topwater fishing involves using floating lures that dance across the top of the water. Some of the most popular topwater lures are poppers, frogs, flies, stick baits, prop baits, and buzz baits. Many of these lures cause a commotion on the surface instigating fish and provoking their predatory instincts. The other baits focus less on large splashes and noise, and instead focus on mimicking an injured prey through movements like walking the dog. Walking the dog involves pulling the lure in a zig zag motion to mimic a fish or frog that is struggling to swim strait. Topwater fishing has to be done when the temperature is right and the visibility is limited.
## Underwater
Most fishing is done underwater as this is where most fish eat. Underwater fishing can include leaving bait on a hook floating under a float, active swimming lures, and pulling baits/lures across the sea floor. Under the water fishing is a large category with many [[References|bait types]] that are mimicked. Some of the bait mimicked underwater are bait fish, crawfish, and worms. Underwater fishing can be useful when the temperature is too hot and fish need to find cool deep water. Along with this, when the temperature is too cold, fish will swim to deeper water that in stable and does not rise and sink with night and day.
