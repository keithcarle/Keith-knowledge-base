# The Time For Each
[[Topwater|Topwater]] fishing can be an action packed thrill. You get to sit there dragging a lure across the top of the water, then *BAM!!*, a giant splash hits right at your lure and the next thing you know your lure is being ripped away from you. It truly is an exciting activity that can be the highlight of your fishing trip. The disappointing part is that topwater fishing can have a limited window available. As mentioned in the [[Temperature|Temperature]] page, water temperature is extremely impactful on the activity and location of fish. Fish will only stay in shallow water or near the top of the water when the temperature is just right. The early mornings, late evenings, and overcast days are best for topwater fishing .[[Underwater|Underwater]] fishing can be better when the temperature is too hot or too cold.
