This is my current go to fishing reel type. The learning curve is a little greater, but these reels offer many benefits. The reels are open faced and the spool freely spins when the button is compressed. This means that you must guide the line with your thumb to keep it from rapidly unraveling. The biggest draw back to these reel is the learning curve and how easily the line can twist and knot. On the other hand, these reels have increased distance, accuracy, drag weight, durability, and can handle heavier weight line and lures.
