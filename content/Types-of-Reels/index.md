# Why so many Reels??
There are many different type of fishing reel and they serve different purposed. The three most common types of reels are those pictured above (spincast, spinning, and baitcaster). Spincast reels are the easiest type and typically the most suitable for beginners. Spinning reels are the most common amongst the fishing community. Baitcaster reels require more skill, but have benefits such as increased distance and accuracy. There are other type of reels, but they more specialized to the type of fishing you are doing such as fly fishing. All three of the types of reels that we are looking at have a drag system. A drag system is used to stop a fish from unwinding your reel when they grab on and swim away.
