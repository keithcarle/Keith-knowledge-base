## Spinning
Spinning reels are the happy balance of simplicity, durability, subject to line twist, casting distance, and accuracy. They can offer a middle ground between the distance, power, durability, and accuracy of spincast and baitcaster reels. Spinning reels are the most versatile as they can be used with moderate or lighter [[Lures-Bait-Types/index|bait/lures]], flipped under tree covers, and used in most situations. One of the largest benefits to spinning reels is the ability to use lighter weight lures/baits. With other reel systems, the lighter weight can make it hard to get far cast distance. The main draw backs of spinner reels, are the increased potential for line twist and that it does not function the best with heavy line or weights.
