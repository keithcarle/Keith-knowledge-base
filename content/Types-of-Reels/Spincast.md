## Spincast
Growing up, many of my first fishing reels were spincast. They are simple, as they have an enclosed design and simple press button. The button is pressed and then released when casting. The button can be pressed again to stop the release of line to put your hook where you want it. Spincast reels are simple and cheaper, but are also less durable and offer less accuracy and distance. Zebco reels are the most common spincast reels. For occasional fishermen, spincast can be the simplest option to focus on the fun of fishing instead of straining to learn new equipment.
