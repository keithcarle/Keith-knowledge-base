# What makes a good fishing spots
There are many things that can make a good fishing spot. In the simplest sense, you are just looking for where the fish are at. Unfortunately, just because you find the fish does not mean that they will bite, this is where [[content/Lures Bait Types/index|Lures/Bait Types]] and [[content/Time of Fishing/index|Time of Fishing]] come into play. The different locations that fish may be can greatly depend on [[content/Saltwater vs Freshwater/index|water type]]. In the end, most of the fish that people go after are predatory fish. Some of these fish are more up for a hunt and will chase after your bait/lure, while others will wait for you to stumble right in front of them before going for the kill. Many of the most popular fishing spots are man-made or natural structures that predatory fish can ambush prey from. This includes docks, piers, rocks, weed beds, fallen trees, reefs, potholes, land points, sandbars, oyster bars, and water run-offs. A important consideration is where bait and prey for the fish are more likely to be. The type of bait and lures you have can also impact which type of structure you might look for. For example, if you have worms then you might not want to look for oyster bars. This is because worms are not a common prey found in oyster beds.
