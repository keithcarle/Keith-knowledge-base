# What Type of Plastic Lure
Two different varieties of lures are soft plastics and hard plastic. Soft plastics refers to lures that are rubbery in order for them to be flexible and flesh-like. Hard plastics are rigid and and typically mimic prey that swim with a side to side action such as small fish.
## Hard Plastics
Hard plastics offer many benefits such as being more durable and simplicity of setting up lures. Many hard plastic lures last for generations and can be effective for many years. These lures can easily be attached strait to fishing line or a leader. Along with this the hooks need to be replaced less often and can easily be switched out or replaced. Hard plastics work very well at mimicking the swishing of a tail when moving through the water. In addition to the swimming appearance, many hard plastics have built in beads for vibrations and/or a bill that allows for the lure to swim up and down in the water as you reel it in. The drawbacks of the lures is that the upfront cost of purchasing them can be expensive and that they can be aggressive and fast paced, which might not appeal to all fish depending on fish behavior and weather.
