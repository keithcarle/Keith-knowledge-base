## Saltwater Vs Freshwater...why's it matter?
[[category-1/index|Saltwater and freshwater]] are drastically different along with the life that lives in them. Not only do saltwater and freshwater have different fish that you may be trying to catch, but they also have different prey that the fish feed on. When fishing, you are trying to trick the fish that your bait/lure is just another common snack for them. For example, if you throw a earth worm out when fishing in a saltwater environment, where they eat saltwater shrimp and smaller fish, the fish might not recognize your worm floating in the water as a snack they need to try to eat. This is why you must tailor your bait to the prey available in the type of water you are fishing in. Below are different prey that are used or mimicked for fishing freshwater and saltwater. You might notice that some of the prey appear to be the same, but there are distinct differences between the freshwater and saltwater versions of prey.
