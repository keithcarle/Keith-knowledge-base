Many people tend to pick to either fish strictly live bait or artificial lures. Both options have benefits and draw backs. Live bait is commonly quoted as the easier option in the fishing community. It is said that live bait does all of the work and does not require skill from the fisherman. Artificial lures can be more difficult as you are trying to convince fish that your lure is a free snack and not plastic. Live bait is going to smell, taste, look, and move like natural prey would for fish. For Lures, you have to make your lure smell like prey instead of plastic, look appealing, and move similar to prey.

Live bait can be cheaper and can increase the odds of getting bites for irregular fishermen. Mastering the skills to make lures move like their prospective prey can be difficult and require a lot of time. Along with this, the cost of acquiring lures for all the different types, color, and sizes of prey can add up extremely quickly. For regular anglers, lures might be a appealing option. Lures can be cheaper if used often as they are reusable. They can also present more of a challenge and involvement, that many angler enjoy in the faster paced experience.
