# Why so many Reels??
There are many different type of fishing reel and they serve different purposed. The three most common types of reels are those pictured above (spincast, spinning, and baitcaster). Spincast reels are the easiest type and typically the most suitable for beginners. Spinning reels are the most common amongst the fishing community. Baitcaster reels require more skill, but have benefits such as increased distance and accuracy. There are other type of reels, but they more specialized to the type of fishing you are doing such as fly fishing. All three of the types of reels that we are looking at have a drag system. A drag system is used to stop a fish from unwinding your reel when they grab on and swim away.

## Spincast
Growing up, many of my first fishing reels were spincast. They are simple, as they have an enclosed design and simple press button. The button is pressed and then released when casting. The button can be pressed again to stop the release of line to put your hook where you want it. Spincast reels are simple and cheaper, but are also less durable and offer less accuracy and distance.
## Spinning
Spinning reels are the happy balance of simplicity, durability, subject to line twist, casting distance, and accuracy. They can offer a middle ground between the distance, power, durability, and accuracy of spincast and baitcaster reels. Spinning reels are the most versatile as they can be used with moderate or lighter [[category-5/Untitled|bait/lures]], flipped under tree covers, and used in most situations. One of the largest benefits to spinning reels is the ability to use lighter weight lures/baits. With other reel systems, the lighter weight can make it hard to get far cast distance. The main draw backs of spinner reels, are the increased potential for line twist and that it does not function the best with heavy line or weights.
## Baitcaster
This is my current go to fishing reel type. The learning curve is a little greater, but these reels offer many benefits. These reels are open faced and the spool freely spins when the button is compressed. This means that you must guide the line with your thumb to keep it from rapidly unraveling. The biggest draw back to these reel is the learning curve and how easily the line can twist and knot. On the other hand, these reels have increased distance, accuracy, drag weight, durability, and can handle heavier weight line and lures.
