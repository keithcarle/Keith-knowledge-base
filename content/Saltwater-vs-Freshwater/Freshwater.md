# Freshwater Fishing
Freshwater is sometimes considered to be more of the beginner option. This is because there are more freshwater options available to people since the saltwater is mostly only found near the ocean. Along with this, freshwater fishing gear can be cheaper and less gear required. Beginners can fish freshwater from piers, riverside/lakeside, bridges, etc. without needing to buy boats or gear to reach far out from land. Freshwater provides smaller fish that can be more manageable for beginners. The environment can also be greatly different, such as freshwater having more vegetation such as weeds, trees, or lily pads.
