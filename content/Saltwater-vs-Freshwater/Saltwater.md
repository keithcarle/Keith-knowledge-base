# Saltwater Fishing
There is much more saltwater available for fishing than there is freshwater as there are much more ocean then lakes and rivers. Saltwater fishing can require more expensive gear such as boats and more durable gear. Saltwater is harsher on gear and requires much more thorough cleaning and corrosion-resistant gear. Beyond the gear requirements, Saltwater houses much bigger fish and deeper fishing than freshwater. The environment are quite different and where you might look for fish can vary because of this. The fish also have different behaviors or instincts than freshwater fish. Some fish are more predatory and will chases lures, while others eat things off the bottom off the sea floor. The bait and lures used in saltwater are specific to saltwater and do not mix well with freshwater bait.
