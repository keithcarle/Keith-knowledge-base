# Water is Water, Right?
When it comes to fishing, saltwater and freshwater are a completely different game. The environments, [[Untitled|bait]], and fish are drastically different. Saltwater and Freshwater have different [[Fishing-Spots/index|fishing spots]] and gear requirements. To some up pretty much everything is different when it comes to the two.


## Saltwater 
There is much more saltwater available for fishing than there is freshwater as there are much more ocean then lakes and rivers. Saltwater fishing can require more expensive gear such as boats and more durable gear. Saltwater is harsher on gear and requires much more thorough cleaning and corrosion-resistant gear. Beyond the gear requirements, Saltwater houses much bigger fish and deeper fishing than freshwater. The environment are quite different and where you might look for fish can vary because of this. The fish also have different behaviors or instincts than freshwater fish. Some fish are more predatory and will chases lures, while others eat things off the bottom off the sea floor. The bait and lures used in saltwater are specific to saltwater and do not mix well with freshwater bait.

## Freshwater
Freshwater is sometimes considered to be more of the beginner option. This is because there are more freshwater options available to people since the saltwater is mostly only found near the ocean. Along with this, freshwater fishing gear can be cheaper and less gear required. Beginners can fish freshwater from piers, riverside/lakeside, bridges, etc. without needing to buy boats or gear to reach far out from land. Freshwater provides smaller fish that can be more manageable for beginners. The environment can also be greatly different, such as freshwater having more vegetation such as weeds, trees, or lily pads.
