# Water is Water, Right?
When it comes to fishing, [[Saltwater|saltwater]] and [[Freshwater|freshwater]] are a completely different game. The environments, [[References|bait]], and fish are drastically different. Saltwater and Freshwater have different [[Fishing-Spots/index|fishing spots]] and gear requirements. To some up pretty much everything is different when it comes to the two.
