# Does the time really matter?
The time can definitely impact how full your ice chest might be after your fishing trip. Morning and night fishing are commonly known as better fishing times. Fish are cold-blooded and can be sensitive to water temperature, light, weather, biometric pressure, and even the moon phases. Early mornings and nights offer lower temperatures and light. Low light conditions can increase your chances of landing a fish since they can not see as well and be more willing to bite your bait/lure. Along with this, fish are more active during low light conditions. As crazy as it may sound, the moon cycle plays a part in the activity of fish. The moon controls the tides, so in some way it has to make sense that it affects the fish as well. There are many other animals that the moon is known to affect their feeding behavior, such as deer.
## Temperature
Temperature plays a major role on how active fish might be. Unfortunately, fish are picky and do not like the water too hot or too cold. As mentioned above, fish are cold-blooded, meaning that they rely on the waters temperature in order to maintain their own temperature. When the water is too hot, fish typically swim deeper to find cooler water. In comparison, when it is cold, fish can swim to shallow water and rock structures to warm up. Along with this, the water temperature is heated up as the day goes on and the sun continues to shine down on the water. So when the temperature is cold, fishing during the day or early evening can result in warmer water and more fish activity.

## Weather
When the weather sharply changes fish eating habits can change. When large storms, cold fronts, etc. are headed towards fish, they can feel the change in the barometric pressure. This can cause fish to eat a large amount to store up energy to front the storm. Along with this, once a storm passes, fish can go back into a feeding frenzy to refill their energy after not eating during the storm. Not only is the time of day important to think about, but when to go fishing in comparison to weather and storms is also important.
