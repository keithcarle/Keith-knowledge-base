My name is Keith Carle and I was born and raised here in south Houston. I am 21 years old and have attended college at Alvin community college and Texas Tech. At 17, I joined the Texas Army Nation Guard, leaving me right at about 4 and a half years in. I grew up fishing salt water with my grandfather and later joined my high school fresh water fishing team. I have always enjoyed fishing and the memories that come with it.
